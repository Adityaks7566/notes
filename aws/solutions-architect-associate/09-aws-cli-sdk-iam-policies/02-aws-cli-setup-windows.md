# AWS CLI Setup on Windows

The Windows version of AWS CLI can be downloaded from [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-windows.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-windows.html) and will list all of the steps to install it.

Once it's installed we can open `cmd` and check `aws --version`.
