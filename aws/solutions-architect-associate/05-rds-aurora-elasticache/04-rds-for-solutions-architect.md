- Read replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements (not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- Amazon RDS supports Transparent Data Encryption for DB encryption:
    - Oracle or SQL Server DB instance only
    - TDE can be used on top of KMS - may affect performance

    - Works for MySQL, PostgreSQL
    - Lifespan of an authentication token is 15 minutes (short-lived)
    - Tokens are generated by AWS credentials
    - SSL must be used when connecting to the database
    - Easy to use EC2 Instance Roles to connect to the RDS database
